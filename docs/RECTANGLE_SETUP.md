## Alternative to Phoenix

Rectangle is much simpler than Phoenix but provides essential window management for development:

- ✅ **Simple**: Easy to set up and use
- ✅ **Reliable**: Stable and well-maintained
- ✅ **Perfect for React development**: Ideal for browser + editor workflows
- ✅ **Multi-monitor support**: Works great with external displays
- ❌ **Less customizable**: Not as powerful as Phoenix
